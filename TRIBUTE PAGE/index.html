          <h2>Father of the Indian Constitution</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as B.R. Ambedkar, was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, India. He was a pioneering social reformer, jurist, economist, and politician, best known for his relentless efforts towards eradicating social discrimination against the untouchables (Dalits) and for his pivotal role in drafting the Indian Constitution.<br>
<br>
Key highlights of his life include:<br>

<br>1. Early Life and Education: Born into a Dalit family, Ambedkar faced severe discrimination. Despite this, he excelled academically, earning degrees from prestigious institutions such as Columbia University and the London School of Economics.<br>

<br>2. Social Reformer: Ambedkar fought tirelessly for the rights of Dalits and other marginalized communities. He led movements against untouchability and worked to secure fundamental rights and social justice for all.<br>

<br>3. Architect of the Indian Constitution: As the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly, he was instrumental in framing the Indian Constitution, ensuring it included provisions for equality, justice, and freedom.<br>

<br>4. Political Career: He served as India's first Law and Justice Minister and was a member of the Constituent Assembly. He also founded the Independent Labour Party and later the Scheduled Castes Federation.
<br>
<br>5. Later Life and Legacy: In his later years, Ambedkar converted to Buddhism, along with many of his followers, as a form of protest against the caste system. He passed away on December 6, 1956. His legacy continues to inspire movements for social justice and equality in India and beyond.
<br>
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar remains a towering figure in Indian history, revered for his contributions to the nation's social and political fabric.
